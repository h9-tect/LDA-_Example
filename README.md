## Topic modeling
Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic
Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that’s capable of scanning a set of documents, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.

You’ve probably been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence, along with terms like machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Especially if you work in a company that processes hundreds, or even thousands of customer interactions every day. Data analysis of social media posts, emails, chats, open-ended survey responses, and more, is not an easy task, and less so when delegated to humans alone.

That’s why many are excited about the implications artificial intelligence could have on their day-to-day tasks, as well as on businesses as a whole. AI-powered text analysis uses a wide variety of methods or algorithms to process language naturally, one of which is topic analysis – used to automatically detect topics from texts. 

By using topic analysis models, businesses are able to offload simple tasks onto machines instead of overloading employees with too much data. Just imagine the time your team could save and spend on more important tasks, if a machine was able to sort through endless lists of customer surveys or support tickets every morning.
